    Initialize: Priority queue (PQ), visited HashSet, parent HashMap, and distances to infinity
    Enqueue {S, 0} into PQ
    while PQ is not empty:
        dequeue node curr from front of queue
        if (curr is not visited)
        add curr to visited set
        If curr == goal return parent map
        for each of curr's neighbors, n, not in visited set:
            if path through curr to n is shorter
                update curr as n's parent in parent map
                enqueue {n, distance} into the PQ
    reaching this line implies there is no path
