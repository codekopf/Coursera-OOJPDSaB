BFS(S,G)
	Initialization of structures
	Enqueue S on stack and add to visited
	while queue is not empty:
		dequeue node curr from top of queue
		if curr == G return parent map
		for each of curr's unvisited neighbors, n:
			add n to visited set
			add curr as n's parent in parent map
			enqueue n to top of queue
		// If we get here then there's no path
