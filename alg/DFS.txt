DFS(S,G)
	Initialization of structures
	Push S on stack and add to visited
	while stack is not empty:
		pop node curr from top of stack
		if curr == G return parent map
		for each of curr's unvisited neighbors, n:
			add n to visited set
			add curr as n's parent in parent map
			push n to top of stack
		// If we get here then there's no path
